title: employer's<br/> support
layout: simple
class: bg-grey

If you are an accepted speaker, and you don't need a grant because your employer is covering your costs of attending, we can recognise your employer for their support. For now, we're planning to get their logo in the programme and a post on the job board. This is opt-in. We hope this will make it a little easier for you to convince your employer to contribute towards your conference costs as a speaker.
