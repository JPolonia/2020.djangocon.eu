This is a conference for software developers, DevOps, entrepreneurs, marketeers, sprouting new Djangonauts, recruiters and exciting partners working with Python and Django.

The attendees is a mixed crowd with various professional positions and levels. Approximately half are newcomers.

Participants are from all over Europe and this edition is heavily represented by the Nordic countries.

We have room for 400 attendees at the venue and at present have sold 3/4 of the tickets.

DjangoCons exist world-wide and the community and audience are from all continents (except perhaps Antarctica?).
