As a speaker, you will not need to buy a ticket, since you gain free entrance to the conference. If you have bought a ticket in advance before being accepted, we will refund it, of course. If you are not selected as a speaker, don't worry because you are still eligible for an early bird ticket. Additionally, there will also be a fancy speakers' dinner!

We will not be able to cover travelling and accommodation costs for all speakers, but if you require financial support, please participate in our [Opportunity Grant process](/information/grants/) ‚Äì speakers will receive special consideration in the selection process.

For companies or employers: talk's content should not be influenced directly by commercial interests, but if your company or employer has supported your process for creating and giving the talk (for instance allowing you to prepare it in working hours), you are *always* welcome to mention this support during a talk. If your employer or company covers travel and accommodation costs, we have a sponsor recognition policy, meaning the company or organisation can join as a sponsor. Please get in touch with [sponsors@djangocon.eu](mailto:sponsors@djangocon.eu) to hear more.
